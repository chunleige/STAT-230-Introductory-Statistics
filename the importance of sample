**Population**

All possible data values in a certain dataset

The entire group that you are interested in for your study. 
For example, if you are surveying people in your company, the population would be all the employees in your company.

**Sample**

A part of a population that is representative of the population 

That is, a subset of your population. 
Just like a food sample, it is called a sample because it is only a taste. 
So if your company is too large to survey every individual, you can survey a representative sample of your population.

**Chanllenges**

Using 100% of a population is time-consuming and expensive. 

**other terms and definitions we should know about sample**

- Margin of error
  
  Since a sample is used to represent a population, the sample’s results are expected to differ from what the result would have been if you had surveyed the entire population. 
  This difference is called the margin of error. 
  The smaller the margin of error, the closer the results of the sample are to what the result would have been if you had surveyed the entire population. 
  
- Confidence level

  How confident you are in the survey results. For example, a 95% confidence level means that if you were to run the same survey 100 times, you would get similar results 95 of those 100 times. 
  Confidence level is targeted before you start your study because it will affect how big your margin of error is at the end of your study. 

- Confidence interval

  The range of possible values that the population’s result would be at the confidence level of the study. This range is the sample result +/- the margin of error.

- Statistical significance

  The determination of whether your result could be due to random chance or not. The greater the significance, the less due to chance.

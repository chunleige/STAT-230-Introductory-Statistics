**Population**

All possible data values in a certain dataset

The entire group that you are interested in for your study. 
For example, if you are surveying people in your company, the population would be all the employees in your company.

**Sample**

A part of a population that is representative of the population 

That is, a subset of your population. 
Just like a food sample, it is called a sample because it is only a taste. 
So if your company is too large to survey every individual, you can survey a representative sample of your population.

**Chanllenges**

Using 100% of a population is time-consuming and expensive.

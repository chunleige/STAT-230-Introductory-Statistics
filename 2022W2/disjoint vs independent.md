In the lab on Wednesday, we discussed one probability problem about disjoint events. 
Some beginners may be confused about what the meaning of "disjoint events". 
In the deeper study in prob and stat, we also need to understand the concept of independence. 
It is also important to understand what is the meaning of "being independent with each other".

Disjoint events and independent events are different. 
Events are considered disjoint if they never occur at the same time; these are also known as mutually exclusive events. 
Events are considered independent if they are unrelated.

**Disjoint Events**

Disjoint events are events that never occur at the same time. These are also known as mutually exclusive events. 

These are often visually represented by a Venn diagram,such as the below.
In this diagram, there is no overlap between event A and event B. These two events never occur together, so they are disjoint events.

**Example**: First-Year & Sophomore Students Section
Let's consider undergraduate class level. A student can be classified as a first-year student, sophomore, junior, or senior.

Being a first-year student and being a sophomore are disjoint events because an individual cannot be classified as both at the same time. 

**Question**: Suppose S = {1, 2, 3}, with P({1}) = 1/2 and P({1, 2}) = 2/3. What must P({2}) and P({3}) be? 

A number can have value 1, 2, or 3 according to the sample space S.

That is, if it is 1, it can not be 2 or 3.

So events {1}, {2}, and {3} are disjoint events.

Following this understanding, we will find P({2})=P({1,2})-P({1})= 2/3-1/2= 1/6

We also know the probability of the entire sample space is 1.

So P({3})=1-P({1})-P({2})=1-1/2-1/6=1/3

or we can quickly use P({3})=1-P({1,2})=1-2/3=1/3

**Independent Events**

Independent events are unrelated events. The outcome of one event does not impact the outcome of the other event. Independent events can, and do often, occur together.

I will add more explanation and examples in the following weeks.

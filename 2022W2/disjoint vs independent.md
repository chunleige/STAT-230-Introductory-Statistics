In the lab on Wednesday, we discussed one probability problem about disjoint. 
Some beginners may be confused about what the meaning of "disjoint events". 
In the deeper study in prob and stat, we also need to understand the concept of independence. 
And what is the meaning of "being independent with each other".

Disjoint events and independent events are different. 
Events are considered disjoint if they never occur at the same time; these are also known as mutually exclusive events. 
Events are considered independent if they are unrelated.

**Disjoint Events**

Disjoint events are events that never occur at the same time. These are also known as mutually exclusive events. 

These are often visually represented by a Venn diagram, such as the below. 
In this diagram, there is no overlap between event A and event B. These two events never occur together, so they are disjoint events.
